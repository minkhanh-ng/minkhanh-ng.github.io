![System Overview](https://enginine.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/media1-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter-1.gif?w=800)

> A turbine pump using analogue sensors for winding and bearing temperature, keyphasor for rotating speed, and velocity sensors for vibration. The program is an implementation of TE2000 and TwinCAT 3, with a custom Fourier function (implemented in case the sensors are not RMS).

### Main Pages Overview
Go around the main pages of the HMI:
